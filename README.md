# Final-Project

This program compares the OPS+ baseball statistics of 3 college baseball players in the Mountain West Conference. The reason they all 
have to be in the same conference is because the calculation for OPS+ uses a league factor that can only be used within 1 conference.

The information that the user will need is the name of the three players he or she wishes to compare, their On-Base-Percentage(OBP), 
and Slugging Percentage(SLG). The league factor is the league OBP and SLG respectively. 

The program will first ask the user for the name of a player. Then it will ask for the playersâ€™ individual OBP and SLG and it will 
print out the OPS+ of that player. 

Next, the user will do the same for the 2nd and 3rd player he or she wishes to compare and at the end the program ranks each OPS+ from 
the highest OPS+ to the lowest OPS+.

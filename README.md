# Final-Project

My final project is a program that calculates the OPS+ of 3 different baseball players in the Mountain West Conference. 

## Usage

Users are prompted to enter the full name, OBP, and SLG of three players. After the SLG of the last player is entered, the program will 
display a vertical list in descending order of the players' calculated OPS+.
